Titan-Hadoop, formerly known as Faunus, is a distributed analytics engine for processing https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Property-Graph-Model[property graph] with http://hadoop.apache.org/[Hadoop].  A http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search[breadth-first] version of the graph traversal language http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com[Gremlin] operates on a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list[vertex-centric] property graph data structure. Titan-Hadoop provides adaptors to the distributed graph database http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/[Titan], to text and binary graphs stored in http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs[HDFS], and to custom formats supported by user extensions. The provided Gremlin operations and Hadoop graph tools can be extended using http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/[MapReduce] and http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com[Blueprints].
